# Liar.js
# Library functions implementations on Array
A javascript based library written from scratch for various algorithmic functions applicable on arrays while writing a code


While designing a algorithm for a specified algorithm,we generally came accross various known functions amd algorithms like searching and sorting 
again and again ,And we have to write the whole part for that and sometimes these makes your code more sophisticated .

Do you really like this ??? No ...right !!
So here is my approach (or idea or whatever you want to say)of writing a javascript based library hich contains all these array operations which are required again and again by your program .
Various algorithms are covered with different complexity ,which one can use based on there needs.

Currently the library is under heavy development and is started as a side project,so it might take time to be completed
Currently 39 different operations can be done:-

1) min :- minimum of two elements of an array
2) max :- maximum of two elements of an array
3) swap:- swapping of elements in 1d as well as in 2d array.
4) reverse:- reversing an array.
5) cloneArray:- making a subset of an array.
6) deletion:- deletion of any element of an array from any position and modifying the array according to that.
7) getsum:-sum of all the elements of an array.
8) getmultiplied:- product of all the elements of an array.
9) mapOnArray:- applying a user defined function on all the elements of an array.
10) countBianry:- counting the number of 0 and 1 in an binary array.
11)countElement:- counting the frequency of each element of an array.
12) RemoveDuplicate:- removing duplicate elements of an array.
13-17) SEARCHING ALGORITHMS BASED FUNCTIONS .
18-27) SORTING ALGORITHMS BASED FUNCTIONS AND SOME OTHER FUNCTIONS LIKE 
(MERGING OF TWO SORTED ARRAYS, PARTITION OF AN ARRAY etc)
28-33)PATTERN SEARCHING ALGORITHMS BASED FUNCTIONS
34-39)OTHERS . . . .


more functions will be added mmvery soon ...
If any one finds any kind of error then please help me as I am also a learner ...
